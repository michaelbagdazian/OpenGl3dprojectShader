# OpenGl3dprojectShader

Requires VM set up found in Moodle course. 

In "OpenGL-Template/src/playground/" I made some changes to the SimpleFragmentShader and SimpleVertexShader to manipulate the shape/color from a red triangle to a blue trapezoid. 

additionally I changed the background color in playground.cpp line 117
